## Day 1

### 🥬 First Crops  
Planting begins today (June 29) here in Australia — right in the middle of winter. I'm starting seeds in trays to give them a head start while it's still cold. Once the risk of frost passes, they'll be ready to move into the raised bed.

Starting with lettuce, broccoli, pumpkins, carrots, beans, and marigold.

### 🪴 Raised Garden Bed  
Great for drainage and controlling soil quality.

### ♻️ Compost Bin  
By recycling kitchen and garden waste, I can continuously feed the soil with organic matter that helps plants grow strong and healthy.
