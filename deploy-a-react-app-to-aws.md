The motivation behind using AWS for home projects is: 

1. **Learning**. The fastest and most effective way to learn anything is by doing it. Big companies don't use Heroku or Netlify to run their online businesses. AWS is a global supercomputer you can leverage at scale to do virtually anything you want. Itâ€™s broken down into Lego blocks of functionality that you can snap together in any configuration you want. Learning all the pieces, how to snap them together, take them apart, then snap them together again differently does take some time and self-education.

2. **Value**. AWS is a pay-as-you-go service much like water or gas, you pay for what you use. In my experience, it's been worth it, only costing a few dollars a month for top quality services. After using free services from smaller hosting companies (that probably use AWS under the covers), strict limits and lack of flexibility make them painful to use.
